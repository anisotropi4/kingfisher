Using the Office of Road and Rail 2021/22 passenger travel data projected onto a shortest-path network using the centre-line track-model this project looks to create visualisation for passenger journey numbers for the active rail stations across the British rail network.

## Station Flow
Individual station flows for the 2 567 stations on the mainline British rail network [here](station.md).

## Acknowledgment
The travel data was kindly provided by Alasdair Rae with the centre-line track-model by Peter Hicks through #OpenRailData.
